## Overview

This 2~ -hour workshop will introduce Islandora objects and how they work within Drupal. It will also cover the basics of Islandora modules, and introduce Drupal/Islandora hooks. The workshop does not cover Solr indexing, Drupal theming, writing tests for Islandora modules or access control in Islandora. It will cover Islandora 7.x-1.x development (that is, Islandora using Drupal 7 and Fedora Commons 3.x), not Islandora CLAW (the ongoing Islandora 2.x project, using Drupal 8 and Fedora Commons 4.x).

The intended audience for the workshop is people who have some experience developing in PHP but not necessarily experience with Drupal. Experience using text editors such as vim, nano/pico or Emacs will be very useful, as will experience using Git.

In the second hour of the workshop, participants will start coding their own simple Islandora module. To prepare for this part of the workshop, make sure you have the following installed on your laptop:

* the [Islandora Vagrant](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_vagrant) virtual machine
* an ssh client
* an scp client if you prefer to work in a graphical text editor on your laptop

The workshop will cover the following topics:

* CRUDable thanks to Islandora
  * Create, read via content-model-specific XML forms (built-in or customized)
  * Read (view) with Islandora viewers 
* Findable, and read-able thanks to indexing in Solr

## Islandora objects

Islandora objects are the basic structural component of content within an Islandora repository. Objects contain properties and datastreams (described below), and are contained within parent objects, typically Islandora collections but in some cases as children of compound objects. Islandora objects are a subclass of [Fedora Commons objects](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA38/Fedora+Digital+Object+Model) that follow specific conventions surrounding datastreams and content models.


![Fedora 3.x Object Model](/images/fedora-DOmodel.png?raw=true "Fedora 3.x Object Model")

This is the Fedora 3 object model. 


### Content models
 
All Islandora objects have one or more content models (usually only one; having more than one is not common). The content model is assigned to an object by a solution pack when the object is created (via a web form or a batch ingest, for example). An object's content model tells Islandora which add/edit metadata form to use, which datastreams are required and optional, and which viewer to use when rendering the object. You can access an object's content models using the `$object->models` property (code) or by peering into the RELS-EXT datastream (GUI). The content models are identified by the `fedora-model:hasModel` relationship in the RELS-EXT datastream, for example, by the following line: 

```xml
[...]
    <fedora-model:hasModel rdf:resource="info:fedora/islandora:sp_basic_image"></fedora-model:hasModel>
[...]
```


Aside: Content models are, themselves, Islandora Objects. They are created when solution packs are installed, and are defined by code in the module file. In the above example, the PID of the content model is `islandora:sp_basic_image`. The `info:fedora` part just tells Fedora that this is a local Fedora object. The content model object defines what datastreams an object of that type is allowed to have, in its own special datastream named DS-COMPOSITE-MODEL. If you don't want to open the object, you can see this in the solution pack module's "ds_composite_model.xml" file. For example, the PDF Solution Pack's [composite model file](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_pdf/blob/7.x/xml/islandora_pdf_ds_composite_model.xml) shows that the OBJ datastream's mime type is "application/pdf", and that the MODS datastream is optional for objects of this content model.



### Properties and datastreams

An Islandora object is made up of properties and datastreams. One way to imagine the relationship between objects, their properties, and their datastreams is to compare an Islandora object to an email message. Where an email message has a subject line and date sent, an Islandora object has the properties "label" and "created date". Where an email message may have attachments (image files, video files, etc.), Islandora objects may have datastreams (also image files, video files, and so on). The analogy breaks down with the email's message body; an Islandora object has no direct counterpart.

An Islandora object's properties include 
 * id (commonly known as its PID, for "persistent ID")
 * label
 * createdDate
 * owner
 * models

Datastreams have their own properties, including
 * id (commonly known as its DSID, for "datastream ID")
 * label
 * checksum
 * content
 * mimetype
 * versionable
 
Full lists of [object properties](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Working-With-Fedora-Objects-Programmatically-Via-Tuque#properties) and [datastream properties](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Working-With-Fedora-Objects-Programmatically-Via-Tuque#properties-1) are available. All Islandora objects have two reserved datastreams, RELS-EXT and DC. The DC datastream contains an XML representation of the object's simple Dublin Core metadata. The RELS-EXT datastream contains an XML representation of the object's relationships with external entities and contains information on the object's content model(s), the Islandora collections it is a member of, and other information. Here is an example of a simple RELS-EXT XML:

```xml
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" xmlns:fedora="info:fedora/fedora-system:def/relations-external#" xmlns:fedora-model="info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model#" xmlns:islandora="http://islandora.ca/ontology/relsext#">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="info:fedora/islandora:73">
    <fedora-model:hasModel rdf:resource="info:fedora/islandora:sp_basic_image"></fedora-model:hasModel>
    <fedora:isMemberOfCollection rdf:resource="info:fedora/islandora:sp_basic_image_collection"></fedora:isMemberOfCollection>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

#### Islandora Conventions

In practice, most Islandora objects also have two other datastreams, the OBJ datastream, which contains the file that the user uploaded to Islandora when the object was initially created, and the MODS datastream, which contains a MODS XML file describing the object. [MODS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) is Islandora's default descriptive metadata schema, although others can be used.

Datastreams can be structurally related to an object in four different ways. These ways are referred to as "control groups" and are:

* Inline XML content (abbreviated "X")
* Managed content (abbreviated "M")
* Externally referenced content (abbreviated "E")
* Redirect referenced content (abbreviated "R")

Inline XML content is stored within an object's FOXML (more information on FOXML is provided below). Managed content is stored as files within Fedora (datastreams of this control group are the rough equivalent of attachments in our email analogy). These two types of datastreams are the most common in Islandora, but E and R datastreams can also be used. Externally referenced content is stored outside of Fedora and is identified within Fedora by a URL; when Fedora needs the datastream's content, it retrieves it from the URL. Redirect referenced content is also identified by a URL, but the datastream's content is never retrieved by Fedora; instead, it just redirects users to the URL.

The Islandora graphical user interface exposes a subset of an object's properties and datastreams to administrative users. To illustrate this, we will use the following basic image object:

![Sample object](/images/sample_object.png?raw=true "Sample object")

The following properties are exposed by the Islandora admin interface, under the object's Manage > Properties tab:

![Sample object properties](/images/sample_object_properties.png?raw=true "Sample object properties")

And the following datastreams are exposed under the object's Manage > Datastreams tab:

![Sample object datastreams](/images/sample_object_datastreams.png?raw=true "Sample object datastreams")

An alternative view of the properties and datastreams is available in the Fedora Web Administrator application (available at http://host:8080/fedora/admin):

![Sample object as viewed in the Fedora Admin app](/images/sample_object_fedora_admin.png?raw=true "Sample object as viewed in the Fedora Admin app")

Using PHP, an Islandora object's properties and datastream properties can be accessed like any other PHP object's properties. Within Islandora modules, you usually have access to either a full Islandora object, or its PID (persistent identifier). A common pattern for accessing the object is:

```php
// If you only have a PID, you must load the corresponding Islandora object.
$object = islandora_object_load($pid);
if ($object) {
  // You can get the object's properties.
  $label = $object->label;
  // Or you can set its properties.
  $object->label = 'New label';
  $object->relationships = $relationships;
}
 ```
 
 To access the object's datastreams individually, you can use this pattern:
 
 ```php
 // $dsid is the datastream ID.
 $datastream = islandora_datastream_load($dsid, $object);
 ```
 or
```php
// $dsid is the datastream ID.
$datastream = $object[$dsid];
```
To get the content of a specific datastream, 
```php
$rawxml = $object['DC']->content;
```

 To access all an object's datastreams: 
 ```php
 foreach ($object as $datastream) {
  // Datastream properties can be gotten and set in ways similar to objects' properties.
  $ds_label = $datastream->label;
  $datastream->label = "New label";
  $datastream_content = $datastream->content;
  $datastream->content = $my_new_content;
}
```

## Islandora's relationship with Drupal

Islandora uses Drupal as a web framework and incorporates all of Drupal's major subsystems:

* The module framework
* The menu system
* The hook system
* Helper functions provided by the Drupal API
* The theme layer
* The database access API
* The batch and queue APIs
* User management and access control
* APIs offered by contrib modules such as Views, Rules, Pathauto, Context, and others

In fact, the only part of Drupal that Islandora doesn't use is the [entity/node subsystem](https://www.drupal.org/node/1261744). Islandora replaces Drupal entities with Islandora objects. There are several modules that integrate Islandora objects with Drupal entities (for instance, [Islandora Sync](https://github.com/islandora/islandora_sync) and [Islandora Entity Bridge](https://github.com/btmash/islandora_entity_bridge)), but by default, Islandora does not create Drupal nodes corresponding to Islandora objects.



## Setting up a development environment

### Islandora Vagrant

The [Islandora Vagrant](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_vagrant) virtual machine offers a full Islandora environment that is both easy to use and customizable.

### Optional: Setting up a shared Modules folder

If you want to edit files in a graphical text editor (or IDE) that you have installed on your local (host) machine, you can set up your modules directory to be shared between your host and your Islandora Vagrant VM:

* Within your Islandora Vagrant directory, `vagrant ssh`
* Run the command 
     `cp -r /var/www/drupal/sites/all/modules /vagrant`
* Exit your vagrant VM with `exit`
* Add the following to your Vagrantfile (e.g. just under the shared_dir line) and save: 

```config.vm.synced_folder "modules", "/var/www/drupal/sites/all/modules"```
* Within your Islandora Vagrant directory, run `vagrant reload`

Now you can edit the files right there, and the results are immediately available to the VM. Note that this method of sharing folders is known to be slow, especially if you have XDebug running. A more performant method is to use your IDE's "deployment" tools that synch files into your VM, but that will not be covered in this workshop.

### Drush

[Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/), the Drupal shell, is an essential tool for Drupal developers and administrators. Some commands you will want to use while you develop for Islandora:

* `drush cc all`: clears all of Drupal's caches.
* `drush en module_name`: enables the module with 'module_name'. If the module is hosted on Drupal.org, will also download it and all module dependencies if necessary.
* `drush dis module_name`: disables the module with 'module_name'.

You run drush commands from anywhere within the Drupal installation directory. Drush is installed and ready to use on the Islandora Vagrant VM.

### Some additional helpful tools

* The [Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) contrib module (installed on the Islandora Vagrant VM)
* The [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) contrib module (installed on the Islandora Vagrant VM)
* The [Islandora Sample Content Generator](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_scg) module


## Islandora's other major components

In addition to Drupal, Islandora uses the following applications and libraries.

### Fedora Commons (a.k.a. Fedora Repository, a.k.a. FCREPO)
[Fedora Repository](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Downloads) provides low-level asset management services within Islandora, including storage, access control, versioning, and checksumming. Islandora's object model, described above, is inherited directly from Fedora Repository's object model.

As mentioned earlier, the current version of Islandora, 7.x-1.x, uses Fedora Repository 3.x, but the Islandora community [is migrating](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Fedora4-Interest-Group) to Fedora Repository version 4.x. Islandora running Fedora 4.x will likely have the pattern 8.x-2.x, as it will be running on Drupal 8.

An important part of Fedora Commons 3.x that is used heavily throughout Islandora is the [Resource Index](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA38/Resource+Index) (abbrieviated "RI"), which provides [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) and [iTQL](http://docs.mulgara.org/itqlcommands/index.html) query interfaces for basic object attributes. Attributes available in the RI are derived from the content of the DC, RELS-EXT, and RELS-INT datastreams, and also include some properties available in the object's FOXML (more on FOXML in a moment).

For debugging or fun, you can access the Resource Index of your installation at http://localhost:8080/fedora/risearch. A sample SPARQL query that you can try out is below. It will return a list of all objects which are members of the Islandora Root collection.
 
```sparql
SELECT ?o
FROM <#ri>
WHERE {
 ?o <fedora-rels-ext:isMemberOfCollection> <info:fedora/islandora:root>}
```

FOXML is an XML representation of the [Fedora object model](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA38/Fedora+Digital+Object+Model). In other words, a Fedora (and Islandora) object's FOXML file contains the object's properties and information about its datastreams. An example of an object's FOXML is [available here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/FOXML+Reference+Example). Islandora doesn't typically modify an object's FOXML directly, but in some cases it parses it to retrieve information that is not easily accessible through other means. FOXML can be used to move objects between instances of Fedora Commons repositories.

### Tuque

[Tuque](https://github.com/Islandora/tuque) is the PHP API that Islandora uses to communicate with Fedora Commons and that translates Fedora Commons objects to and from PHP objects. Tuque is basically a wrapper around Fedora's REST interface. Tuque is `included` by the core Islandora module, which makes its functionality available within the Drupal environment for all other modules. Module developers don't need to `include` it in their code themselves.

Tuque can be used outside of the Islandora codebase as a standalone API library. Here is a sample script that connects to the Fedora repository and issues a query against the Resource Index to get a list of all objects that are members of a specific collection.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Sample tuque script that queries the Fedora Resource Index to get a list of
 * all objects that are children of the islandora:sp_basic_image_collection.
 */

$fedora_user = 'fedoraAdmin';
$fedora_pass = 'fedoraAdmin';
$fedora_url = 'http://localhost:8080/fedora';
$collection = 'islandora:sp_basic_image_collection';

/**
 * Load Tuque API.
 */
include_once 'tuque/Datastream.php';
include_once 'tuque/FedoraApi.php';
include_once 'tuque/FedoraApiSerializer.php';
include_once 'tuque/Object.php';
include_once 'tuque/RepositoryConnection.php';
include_once 'tuque/Cache.php';
include_once 'tuque/RepositoryException.php';
include_once 'tuque/Repository.php';
include_once 'tuque/FedoraRelationships.php';

// Connect to the Fedora repo.
try {
  $connection = new RepositoryConnection($fedora_url, $fedora_user, $fedora_pass);
}
catch (Exception $e) {
  print $e->getMessage();
}

$api = new FedoraApi($connection);
$cache = new SimpleCache();
$repository = new FedoraRepository($api, $cache);

// Query the rindex to get all the objects that have a 'isMemberOfCollection'
// relationship with the specified collection.
$ri_query = 'select $object from <#ri>
  where  $object <fedora-rels-ext:isMemberOfCollection> <info:fedora/' . $collection . '>';
  $members = $repository->ri->itqlQuery($ri_query, 'unlimited');

print "Members of the '$collection' collection\n\n";

// Printn out their PIDs.
foreach ($members as $member) {
  print $member['object']['value'] . "\n";
}
```

The standard [documentation](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Working-With-Fedora-Objects-Programmatically-Via-Tuque) for Tuque is essential reading and reference material for Islandora developers.

### Solr

[Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) provides search and retrieval functionality for metadata contained in Islandora objects' XML datastreams, and for full text of books, newspapers, and other types of content. Solr extracts query-able content from datastreams using a third-party application called the [Generic Search Service](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCSVCS/Generic+Search+Service+2.7) (or more commonly, gsearch). To configure what information gets pulled out of your object and into Solr, you will have to configure some XSLT's within Gsearch. 

The general difference between Fedora's Resource Index and Solr is that the RI is used for querying object properties, while Solr is used for querying datastream content. For example, when an Islandora module needs to find all of the pages in a book, it will query the RI, because that is where the object's "isPageOf" relationship is stored; when a user wants to find all books that contain the keywords "dog" and "sled", Islandora queries Solr, because the OCR datastreams of book pages are indexed in Solr. Solr is also much faster, and scales better. However the RI is more powerful, and you can chain together queries, e.g. find me all the parent collections of objects with TN datastreams.

\* Technically this can be done in Solr depending on your particular schema using a JOIN
http://localhost:8080/solr/select?q={!join from=RELS\_EXT\_isMemberOfCollection\_uri\_ms to=PID}datastreams\_ms:"TN"

### FedoraGenericSearch (GSearch)

[GSearch](https://github.com/fcrepo3/gsearch) is a Java application that listens to a JMS Queue for messages from a Fedora Repository and operates when it receives one. This operation is to add/update or delete a corresponding record from a configured Solr Repository.

Normally GSearch is installed in your Tomcat Application container. Once configured all the pieces are located in 
```
$CATALINA\_HOME/webapps/fedoragsearch/WEB-INF/classes/fgsconfigFinal/
⊢ index/FgsIndex - Contains your XSLTs and configuration parameters
⊢ updater/FgsUpdaters - Contains configuration parameters of the message consumers
⊢ repository/FgsRepos - Contains configuration parameters of the Fedora repository
﹂ fedoragsearch.properties - contains configuration parameters
```

## Islandora modules

### Types

Islandora modules can be grouped into four rough categories:

* solution packs: modules that define content models, provide add/edit forms, and build display pages for various types of Islandora objects
  * [Book Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book)
  * [Compound Object Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_compound)
  * [PDF Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_pdf)
* viewer modules: modules that provide rich viewers for datastreams
  * [Islandora OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_openseadragon)
  * [Islandora PDF.js](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_pdfjs)
* integration modules: modules that integrate Islandora objects with other components of the Islandora stack or with Drupal APIs
  * [Islandora Batch](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_batch)
  * [Islandora Solr Views](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solr_views)
  * [Islandora XACML Editor](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_xacml_editor)
* utility modules: modules that perform a set of tasks related to Islandora objects or the Islandora stack
  * [Islandora Checksum](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_checksum)
  * [Islandora Pathauto](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_pathauto)
  * [Islandora XML Forms](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_xml_forms)

These categories are for overview purposes only; there are no code-level or structural requirements for the various types. Two exceptions are that 1) solution packs generally provide collection policy and MODS forms definition files, and implement some specific functions that register these; and 2) viewer modules implement `hook_islandora_viewer_info()`.

### Structure

The standard approach to extending Drupal is through modules. Islandora modules follow the patterns established for Drupal modules. The most basic Islandora module contains two files, an .info file and a .module file, within a directory. Here are some examples of the structure of Islandora modules, in increasing order of complexity:

Simplest (the module that you'll be playing with during this workshop):

```
.
├── islandora_dev101.info
├── islandora_dev101.module
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
```

LICENSE and README.md are not required for the module to work but should always be present as a convention. An example of a module of average complexity is [Islandora FITS](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_fits):
```
.
├── build
│   └── Doxyfile
├── build.xml
├── css
│   └── islandora_fits.css
├── includes
│   ├── admin.form.inc
│   └── derivatives.inc
├── islandora_fits.info
├── islandora_fits.install
├── islandora_fits.module
├── LICENSE.txt
├── README.md
└── theme
    └── islandora-fits-metadata.tpl.php
```

A module of greater complexity is [Islandora Book Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book):

```
.
├── build
│   └── Doxyfile
├── build.xml
├── css
│   └── islandora_book.css
├── data
│   ├── datastreams
│   │   ├── islandora_bookCModel_ds_composite_model.xml
│   │   └── islandora_book_collection_policy.xml
│   └── forms
│       └── book_form_mods.xml
├── images
│   └── folder.png
├── includes
│   ├── admin.form.inc
│   └── manage_book.inc
├── islandora_book.info
├── islandora_book.install
├── islandora_book.module
├── LICENSE.txt
├── README.md
├── tests
│   ├── fixtures
│   │   └── test.tiff
│   ├── islandora_book_derivatives_ingest_purge.test
│   ├── islandora_book_ingest_purge.test
│   └── scripts
│       ├── adore.sh
│       └── tesseract.sh
└── theme
    ├── islandora-book-book.tpl.php
    ├── islandora-book-page-img-print.tpl.php
    ├── islandora-book-page.tpl.php
    └── theme.inc
```

### Islandora coding conventions

Like any quality open source software application and community, Islandora uses a set of well-documented coding conventions. [The official wiki page](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Coding-Standards) provides explanations and examples. When you are coding Islandora modules, you should get in the habbit of running the following command within your module directory:

`drush dcs`

This command runs executes PHP_CodeSniffer, the standard PHP source code style analysis tool, to enforce Drupal coding standards, and if it finds any, will provide a detailed report.

The most common errors many developers make are:

* improper indentation (use 2 spaces for each level)
* white space at the end of lines (this is not allowed)
* white space at the end of files (not allowed)
* missing or improper file and function comments.

Many Islandora developers configure their text editors and IDEs to use PHP_CodeSniffer.


### Islandora API

The core Islandora module provides an API that module developers can use. This API includes a number of Drupal hooks, documented at [islandora.api.php](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/7.x/islandora.api.php), and a number of helper functions, many of which are defined in various .inc files within the [Islandora module's includes directory](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/tree/7.x/includes). `islandora_object_load()`, which is defined in the islandora.module file, is an example of these helper functions.

### Hooks

Drupal is designed to be highly extensible, and a basic tenet of Drupal development is "Never hack core." The most important way to extend Drupal is to implement a hook in a module. A Drupal (and Islandora) hook is a special type of function that is fired at a predefined time in the execution of a page request. They are "defined" by a module and "implemented" by other modules. In this way, hooks let a Drupal module add functionality that can be used by another module. Unlike an ordinary function, which you call to get an expected return value, implementing a hook lets you write a function that always gets called by Drupal at a specific time on a specific event. More information on hooks is available from [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/292).

For example, `hook_islandora_object_access()` is defined by the Islandora module, but is used by many other modules to determine whether a user is allowed to perform a specific action on an object.

Here is the entry in [islandora.api.php](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/7.x/islandora.api.php) for `hook_islandora_object_access()`:

```php
/**
 * Object-level access callback hook.
 *
 * @param string $op
 *   A string define an operation to check. Should be defined via
 *   hook_permission().
 * @param AbstractObject $object
 *   An object to check the operation on.
 * @param object $user
 *   A loaded user object, as the global $user variable might contain.
 *
 * @return bool|NULL|array
 *   Either boolean TRUE or FALSE to explicitly allow or deny the operation on
 *   the given object, or NULL to indicate that we are making no assertion
 *   about the outcome. Can also be an array containing multiple
 *   TRUE/FALSE/NULLs, due to how hooks work.
 */
function hook_islandora_object_access($op, $object, $user) {
  switch ($op) {
    case 'create stuff':
      return TRUE;
    case 'break stuff':
      return FALSE;
    case 'do a barrel roll!':
      return NULL;
  }
}
```

The entry provides the function signature and the parameter/return documentation, plus (in some cases) some sample code. The function signature begins with the word 'hook' but when we implement the hook in our modules, we replace that with the name of the module. This "magic" naming convention is how Drupal knows to fire the hook implementations.

Here are three implementations of the hook. First, from islandora.module itself:

```php
/**
 * Implements hook_islandora_object_access().
 *
 * Denies according to PID namespace restrictions, then passes or denies
 * according to core Drupal permissions according to user_access().
 */
function islandora_islandora_object_access($op, $object, $user) {
  module_load_include('inc', 'islandora', 'includes/utilities');

  return islandora_namespace_accessible($object->id) && user_access($op, $user);
}
```

From islandora_scholar_embargo.module:

```php
/**
 * Implements hook_islandora_object_access().
 */
function islandora_scholar_embargo_islandora_object_access($op, $object, $user) {
  module_load_include('inc', 'islandora_scholar_embargo', 'includes/embargo');
  if ($op == 'administer islandora_xacml_editor') {
    $embargoed = islandora_scholar_embargo_get_embargoed($object);
    if (!empty($embargoed)) {
      return FALSE;
    }
  }
}
```
From islandora_basic_collection.module:

```php
/**
 * Implements hook_islandora_object_access().
 *
 * Maps our three permissions onto those in the Islandora core.
 */
function islandora_basic_collection_islandora_object_access($op, $object, $user) {
  $result = NULL;

  $collection_models = islandora_basic_collection_get_collection_content_models();
  $is_a_collection = (
    (count(array_intersect($collection_models, $object->models)) > 0) &&
    isset($object['COLLECTION_POLICY'])
  );

  if (in_array($op, array_keys(islandora_basic_collection_permission()))) {
    if ($is_a_collection) {
      if ($op == ISLANDORA_BASIC_COLLECTION_CREATE_CHILD_COLLECTION) {
        $result = islandora_object_access(ISLANDORA_INGEST, $object, $user) && islandora_datastream_access(ISLANDORA_VIEW_OBJECTS, $object['COLLECTION_POLICY'], $user);
        if ($result) {
          $policy = new CollectionPolicy($object['COLLECTION_POLICY']->content);
          $policy_content_models = $policy->getContentModels();
          $result = count(array_intersect($collection_models, array_keys($policy_content_models))) > 0;
        }
      }
      elseif ($op == ISLANDORA_BASIC_COLLECTION_MANAGE_COLLECTION_POLICY) {
        $result = islandora_datastream_access(ISLANDORA_METADATA_EDIT, $object['COLLECTION_POLICY'], $user);
      }
      elseif ($op == ISLANDORA_BASIC_COLLECTION_MIGRATE_COLLECTION_MEMBERS) {
        // Not sure how much sense this makes... Check that we can modify the
        // RELS-EXT of the current object, assuming that we'll be able to modify
        // the children as well...
        $result = islandora_datastream_access(ISLANDORA_METADATA_EDIT, $object['RELS-EXT'], $user);
      }
    }
    else {
      $result = FALSE;
    }
  }

  return $result;
}
```

Hooks are fired in the defining module's code via the [Drupal API function](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!module.inc/function/module_invoke_all/7) `module_invoke_all()`, which iterates through all modules and, if a module implements the hook, fires it.

Islandora provides many hooks. In the first exercise below, we'll implement the ones that are fired during the object add/update/purge lifecycle, and a couple of others.

## Hands-on exercices

These exercises focus on understanding and implementing Islandora hooks. Their usefulness as solutions to real problems is secondary to their ability to illustrate when hooks are fired, and what variables are available within the implemented hook functions.

When we write code in exercies 1 and 3, we'll use simple functions such as `drupal_set_message()` and `dd()` to "do something". The module file `islandora_dev101.module` provides some scaffolding for the exercises. Exercise 2 is not a coding exercise, but it will get us looking at the documentation for hooks and at examples implementations in other modules.

### Exercise 1: Doing something when objects are added, modified, or purged

In this exercise, we will implement a few Islandora hooks that will let us display a message to the user (or write a message to a file) when objects are added, modified, and deleted, or write the message to a file.

1. Open the islandora_dev101.module file in an editor and add either `drupal_set_message()` to display a message to the user or `dd()` to write the message to a file where it says "// Do something" in the three function signatures (that is, hook implementations) at the bottom of the file. If you use `dd()`, the file written to will be `/tmp/drupal_debug.txt`.
2. Your code should print a property of the Islandora object, such as ID or owner.
3. As a bonus, configure your own message in the module's admin settings form and then retrieve that message within your functions using `variable_get('islandora_dev101_message', 'This just happened: ')`. Print the message along with the object property.

A [sample implementation](https://gist.github.com/mjordan/99fac083970ea43528c6) is available.

### Exercise 2: Exploring islandora.api.php

In this exercise, we will take a detailed look at [islandora.api.php](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/7.x/islandora.api.php), the standard documentation for the hooks that Islandora provides to developers. We will also look at some examples in Islandora modules.

1. Look up the entry for `hook_islandora_object_alter()` in the API documentation.
2. Find an implementation of this hook in an Islandora module, either in the ones installed on your VM or on Github.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for `hook_islandora_datastream_modified()`, `hook_islandora_ingest_steps()`, and `hook_islandora_derivative()`.

### Exercise 3: Doing something with a datastream

In this exercise, we will implement a hook that will write the content of an object's DC datastream to a file every time an object is viewed.

1. Find a suitable Islandora hook that will fire when an object is viewed. Your instructor will have some suggestions.
2. Open the islandora_dev101.module file in an editor and add your implementation of the hook.
3. Access the DC datastream's content using `$object['DC']->content` and print it to a file using the `dd()` function. If you prefer to write non-Drupal PHP code (e.g., file_put_contents()) to write the file instead of using `dd()`, feel free to do so.
4. As a bonus, print the content of the RELS-EXT datastream.

Some [sample implementations](https://gist.github.com/mjordan/4ae7724d5b3ffe38207f) are available.

## Contributing back to the community

The Islandora Community thrives due to the help of developers/administrators/users from all over sharing knowledge, code and time for the benefit of all. We love to get help with improved documentation, bug fixes, improvements or even whole new modules. 

When you are ready to contribute back, here are a couple of reminders.

### Contributor License Agreements

You need to have a [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Contributor-License-Agreements) on file with the Islandora Foundation before we can accept any updates to the codebase (this includes README updates).

You need an **individual contributor license agreement** if you are contributing code from your own Github account and you need a **corporate contributor license agreement** if you are submitting from a work account.

### JIRA tickets

For any work that you do it's best to make a JIRA ticket - http://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA

You can sign up for a JIRA account (if you have any issues contact Melissa Anez (manez at islandora dot ca))

To work a ticket you:

  * Create a ticket / Find a ticket you'd like to work
  * Assign the ticket to yourself, if you can't do that contact Melissa Anez or Danny Lamb they can help.
  * Press the "**Start Work**" button, so we know its is underway.
  * Once you are ready and have made a pull request with your work
     * please add the pull request to the ticket in a comment
     * press the "**Start Review**" button
  
### Test any problems and solutions on a clean install

Sometimes configuration changes can have unexpected consequences. Therefore we ask that before you submit a bug, if you can confirm that it occurs in a clean install of the 7.x branch of Islandora. Islandora Vagrant is of particular benefit for this task.

### Clean your code

Each pull request is tested using the Travis CI (continuous integration) system. This will check for code style and run any configured tests. You can perform these tasks locally before submitting your pull requests to avoid the issues later.
